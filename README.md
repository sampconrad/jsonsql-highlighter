## ðŸŽ¯ Perfect For

- **Configuration files** with embedded SQL queries that need proper syntax highlighting
- **Database migration scripts** stored in JSON format with complex SQL statements  
- **API responses** containing SQL queries that require editing and formatting
- **Development workflows** where SQL is stored as JSON strings in configuration
- **Code reviews** of JSON files with embedded SQL - much easier to read and understand

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Highlighting

The extension provides distinct visual cues for different elements based on your VS Code theme colors:

**Before:** Plain JSON with unreadable SQL strings
